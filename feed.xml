I am not a Revit true-believer yet, but I give credit where its due and so far the Revit API has been quite impressive. It is lacking a lot of things, but generally you can work around them one way or another. One such pain that many of us encounter is a limited number of places you can actually do work. Which again, isn’t a big deal, but I do ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Revit Shortcuts for AutoCAD Users</title><link href="/posts/revit-shortcuts-for-autocad-users/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revit Shortcuts for AutoCAD Users" /><published>2020-02-08T13:04:00-07:00</published> <updated>2020-02-08T13:04:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/revit-shortcuts-for-autocad-users/</id> <content src="/posts/revit-shortcuts-for-autocad-users/" /> <author> <name>homeofbim</name> </author> <category term="Revit" /> <summary> This is something of a sensitive topic. A pure-Revit guy would consider this blasphemy, but for an AutoCAD user, what I have done could be a real blessing. From my perspective, if you have skills, then you should be able to use them and the design software should be a nearly irrelevant factor on whether or not you can competently coordinate a project. I fundamentally believe people should be en... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>HOB Lisp Explorer</title><link href="/posts/hob-lisp-explorer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="HOB Lisp Explorer" /><published>2019-11-03T10:27:00-07:00</published> <updated>2019-11-03T10:27:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/hob-lisp-explorer/</id> <content src="/posts/hob-lisp-explorer/" /> <author> <name>homeofbim</name> </author> <category term=".NET" /> <category term="Lisp" /> <summary> Today I present another long awaited free utility that should help fellow lisper’s better utilize their Lisp libraries. For those of us who have have written many thousands of lines and often find it easier to start from scratch than locate something we worked on 2 or 3 years ago; this tool is for you! Although I would honestly recommend this tool to people who are trying to learn as well.

Most notably with the object enabler. Even standard users have probably noticed new (important) properties like ItemSpoolName showing up in Navisworks. What may not have realized is that they made some important properties programmatically Read/Write. Until recently, the only property we could write... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Navisworks to AutoCAD - an FBX Workaround and More</title><link href="/posts/navisworks-to-autocad-an-fbx-workaround-and-more/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Navisworks to AutoCAD - an FBX Workaround and More" /><published>2019-09-03T19:03:00-07:00</published> <updated>2019-09-03T19:03:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/navisworks-to-autocad-an-fbx-workaround-and-more/</id> <content src="/posts/navisworks-to-autocad-an-fbx-workaround-and-more/" /> <author> <name>Skylar Daniels</name> </author> <category term="AutoCAD" /> <category term="Navisworks" /> <summary> For anyone who uses AutoCAD (with or without one of its verticals) to create models on a BIM job, chances are high that you are also using Navisworks simultaneously to coordinate the 3D space with other trades. Chances are also just as high that you have needed to reference this Coordination model in AutoCAD in order to clear clashes, connect to points of use, utilize a shared hanger, or other ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>SharePoint Formula UDL for Notepad++</title><link href="/posts/sharepoint-formula-udl-for-notepad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SharePoint Formula UDL for Notepad++" /><published>2019-08-07T15:20:00-07:00</published> <updated>2019-08-07T15:20:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/sharepoint-formula-udl-for-notepad/</id> <content src="/posts/sharepoint-formula-udl-for-notepad/" /> <author> <name>Josh Howard</name> </author> <category term="Notepad++" /> <category term="UDL" /> <summary> I still have a great lisp management tool coming, but lately I’ve been writing some very rigid SharePoint validation formulas and couldn’t find a good syntax highlighting utility. The closest thing I found was for Excel. Which is extremely similar, but it has 3-4x the number of functions that SharePoint does and I was generally looking for something more complete for my needs. So, I just made m... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Notepad++ UDL Highlighting for COD &amp; DCL Languages</title><link href="/posts/notepad-udl-highlighting-for-cod-dcl-languages/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Notepad++ UDL Highlighting for COD &amp; DCL Languages" /><published>2019-03-23T21:32:00-07:00</published> <updated>2019-03-23T21:32:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/notepad-udl-highlighting-for-cod-dcl-languages/</id> <content src="/posts/notepad-udl-highlighting-for-cod-dcl-languages/" /> <author> <name>Josh Howard</name> </author> <category term="Notepad++" /> <category term="UDL" /> <summary> Dialog Control Language UDL We had a DLL AutoCAD command that we lost the code to quite some time ago and wanted to “update” its functionality. We could have done this through lisp quite easily, but there was one complex dialog associated with it. I’ve always hated the Dialog Control Language in AutoCAD, but it certainly does work after a lot of tinkering.

I know it was a constant irritation of mine years ago when I was first using P3D. Especially since there were so many logical applications for standardized notes that could be made if they would just let me.

However, over the years I have made lots of lisp routines that enhance or modify existing tables created by a piping software and in truth I’ve even lazily used the DATAEXTRACTION command as part of a manual 2D isometric programs BOM.
